**#Project Title:** TicTacToeGame

**#Project Goal:** For making a Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played by two players.

**#Project Requirements: ** This game must be able to be played by two players. The game must be able to determine the winner of the game.

**#Challenges:** The main challenge of my project is to implement result dialog with View Binding. I want to develop this app where two
 players can take gaming experience perfectly without feeling insecurity.
